classes:
Main-
    I\O for files- read, write
    reads file *twice* , sends lines to parser, ignores whitespaces
    driver for program

    first pass:
        -eliminate whitespaces
        -initialize symbol table + parse labels + get variables
    second pass:
        -parse instructions- send each line to parser

Parser- gets file content line by line from main
    unpack instructions
    identifies what type of instruction, returns type + parsed instruction to main

    supports shifts

Code-
    holds instance of SymbolTable- (gets once from main?)
    holds array of instructions translated to binary
    gets each field from instructions from main, translates to binary
    diff methods for each line type:
        C-instruction
        A-instruction
        Labels

    supports shifts

SymbolTable-
    holds array member as symbol table
    gets array of file lines
    initializes built in symbols
    finds labels and adds to table + erases from file line array
    get variables + add to symbol table
    returns array to main
