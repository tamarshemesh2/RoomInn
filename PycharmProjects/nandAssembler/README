                        ---------------------


Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
SymbolTable.py - contains the table with all the symbols and their addresses in an instruction file
Assembler.py - manages the parsing and translating of the instructions
Code.py - manages the translation of the instructions to their binary form
Parser.py - manages the parsing of instructions by determining which type they are and dividing each
            instruction accordingly
Makefile - Makefile for a Assembler.py, project 6

Remarks
-------
we followed the given API from the lecture with a small change.
In the implementation of the Parser we chose to divide the shift operation from the normal comp and c_instruction
because its unique binary translation. that translation uses different bit in the instruction.(14-10 instead of 8-13)
